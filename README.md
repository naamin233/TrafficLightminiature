# ðŸš¦ Smart Traffic Light System Using Object Detection

## ðŸ“˜ Project Summary

This project aims to design and implement a smart traffic light control system that adapts to real-time traffic conditions using object detection. Traditional traffic lights operate on fixed timers, often causing unnecessary delays and congestion. By detecting the presence and type of vehicles (car, bus, lorry, van, and bicycle), the traffic light timing can be adjusted dynamically to improve flow and reduce idle time.

The system is tested in two environments: simulation using SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) and a physical prototype using toy vehicles, Raspberry Pi, and LED-based traffic lights.
